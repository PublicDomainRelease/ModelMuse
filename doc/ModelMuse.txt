ModelMuse is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) models MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-NWT, MODPATH, ZONEBUDGET, and 
PHAST and for MT3DMS.  This software package provides a GUI for creating the flow 
and transport input  file for PHAST and the input files for MODFLOW–2005. In 
ModelMuse, the spatial data for the model are independent of the grid, and the 
temporal data are independent of the stress periods. Being able to input these 
data independently allows the user to redefine the spatial and temporal 
discretization at will. This report describes the basic concepts required to work 
with ModelMuse. These basic concepts include the model grid, data sets, formulas, 
objects, the method used to assign values to data sets, and model features.

The ModelMuse main window has a top, front, and side view of the model that can 
be used for editing the model, and a 3–D view of the model that can be used to 
display properties of the model. ModelMuse has tools to generate and edit the 
model grid. It also has a variety of interpolation methods and geographic 
functions that can be used to help define the spatial variability of the model. 
ModelMuse can be used to execute MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-NWT, MODPATH, 
ZONEBUDGET, MT3DMS, and PHAST and can also display the results of MODFLOW–2005, 
MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-LGR, MODPATH, and MT3DMS models. An example of using 
ModelMuse with  MODFLOW–2005 is included in the report. Several additional examples 
are described in the help system for ModelMuse, which can be accessed from the Help 
menu.
