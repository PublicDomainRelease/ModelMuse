ModelMuse is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) models MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-LGR2, MODFLOW-NWT, MODPATH, 
ZONEBUDGET, PHAST, and SUTRA and for MT3DMS.  This software package provides 
a GUI for creating the flow and transport input  file for PHAST and the input 
files for MODFLOW, MT3DMS, and SUTRA. In 
ModelMuse, the spatial data for the model are independent of the grid, and the 
temporal data are independent of the stress periods. Being able to input these 
data independently allows the user to redefine the spatial and temporal 
discretization at will. This report describes the basic concepts required to work 
with ModelMuse. These basic concepts include the model grid, data sets, formulas, 
objects, the method used to assign values to data sets, and model features.

The ModelMuse main window has a top, front, and side view of the model that can 
be used for editing the model, and a 3–D view of the model that can be used to 
display properties of the model. The side view is hidden for SUTRA models
ModelMuse has tools to generate and edit the 
model grid. It also has a variety of interpolation methods and geographic 
functions that can be used to help define the spatial variability of the model. 
ModelMuse can be used to execute MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-LGR2, 
MODFLOW-NWT, MODPATH, ZONEBUDGET, MT3DMS, SUTRA and PHAST and can also display 
the results of MODFLOW–2005, MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-LGR2, MODPATH, 
SUTRA and MT3DMS models. An example of using 
ModelMuse with  MODFLOW–2005 is included in the report. Several additional examples 
are described in the help system for ModelMuse, which can be accessed from the Help 
menu.

This report (1) describes modifications to ModelMuse,as described in U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS) Techniques and Methods (TM) 6–A29 (Winston, 2009), to add support for 
the Saturated-Unsaturated Transport model (SUTRA) (Voss and Provost, 2002; version 
of September 22, 2010) and (2) supplements USGS TM 6–A29. Modifications include 
changes to the main ModelMuse window where the model is designed, addition of methods 
for generating a finite-element mesh suitable for SUTRA, defining how some functions 
should apply when using a finite-element mesh rather than a finite-difference grid 
(as originally programmed in ModelMuse), and applying spatial interpolation to angles. 
In addition, the report describes ways of handling objects on the front view of the 
model and displaying data. A tabulation contains a summary of the new or modified 
dialog boxes.
