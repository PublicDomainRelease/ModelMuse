    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">ModelMuse is a graphical user interface (GUI) for MODFLOW-2005 and PHAST. &#160;This software package provides a GUI for creating the flow and transport input file for PHAST and the input files for MODFLOW-2005. &#160;In ModelMuse, the spatial data for the model are independent of the grid, and the temporal data are independent of the stress periods. &#160;Being able to input these data independently allows the user to redefine the spatial and temporal discretization at will. &#160;This report describes the basic concepts required to work with ModelMuse. &#160;These basic concepts include the model grid, data sets, formulas, objects, the method used to assign values to data sets, and model features.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">The ModelMuse main window has a top, front, and side view of the model that can be used for editing the model, and a 3-D view of the model that can be used to display properties of the model. &#160;ModelMuse has tools to generate and edit the model grid. It also has a variety of interpolation methods and geographic functions that can be used to help define the spatial variability of the model. &#160;ModelMuse can be used to execute both MODFLOW-2005 and PHAST and can also display the results of MODFLOW-2005 models. An example of using ModelMuse with MODFLOW-2005 is included in this report. Several additional examples are described in the help system for ModelMuse, which can be accessed from the Help menu.</text></para>
